       "\"Yes, fuel efficiency standards would send an important market signal to manufacturers. They would need to be introduced fairly quickly to avoid dumping of cheaper, less efficient vehicles before their importation was banned. There might need to be a tax on large inventories of less fuel efficient vehicles.- Increasing the number and proportion of new and second-hand EV registrations overall- The availability and takeup of more electricity-efficient EVs for people who don't need high-performance vehicles.- The proportion of workplaces and commuter carparks which offer EV charging facilities- The amount of otherwise unused electricity from rooftop solar being used instead to charge EVs during daylight hours, and the takeup of bidirectional charging to improve grid capacity during peak periods.Provide TAFE places to train mechanics in the maintenance and repair of EVs, tax incentives for domestic EV vehicle and component manufacturing, and for the repurposing of batteries no longer usable in vehicles but suitable for other applications such as home or community electricity storage.Provide incentives for the repurposing of batteries no longer suitable for EVsThe objectives should be broadened to include electrification of major interstate rail routes, incentives to move more freight onto rail (and thus the number of heavy road vehicles on major routes), and proper weight-based road user charges for heavy vehiclesThere is a role for both government and industry, but government needs to take the lead.Measures should include Information about the comparative long-term costs of EVs and ICE vehicles in various scenarios (e.g. mostly daily city commutes, regular longer-distance driving in regional areas). This would include information on the real-world range each vehicle could realistically be expected to achieve at nominal charging conditions (say 10 to 80 per cent), with allowances for Australian conditions, rather than just the WLTP figure.Prominent road signs pointing to public EV charging facilities in urban and regional areas, and along highways, ideally showing real-time availability of those chargers.Interoperability between commercial chargers (avoiding the need for separate cards or apps for each operator).A 'show rather than just tell' approach, in government-sponsored information campaigns might, have people to talk about their EV experiences, such as how they overcame their initial scepticism.Anecdotally, some car dealers are reluctant to promote EVs to consumers. Perhaps government could provide a small incentive payment to dealers who encourage customers to look at EV models.Yes, they are important in reducing emissions, in the same way that the phasing out of leaded petrol in the 1980s produced positive health outcomes. People would need to be reassured that higher fuel standards would not adversely affect existing vehicles, nor significantly increase their fuel costs.CityDistance-based road user charges for all vehicles based on axle weights for all light and heavy vehicles. Congestion charges,with a weighting based on emissions (i.e. lower charges for low and no-emission vehicles)/Yes, by simplifying the import of right-hand-drive 2nd hand vehicle which meet key safety rules.Australia will continue to be a dumping ground for ICE vehicles, and most EV manufacturers will continue to preference other countries, furthering the market dominance of Tesla to the exclusion of other brands and possibly stifling local EV manufacturing.A lack of supply will also further delay development of a domestic second-hand market.By encouraging governments and other fleet buyers (including car rental firms) to buy EV fleets wherever possible.Developing incentives, standards and kits for people wanting to convert ICE vehicles to electric operationRequiring the fitting (and over time retro-fitting) of powerpoints and/or EV chargers in apartment building carparksIncentives to encourage service station owners to provide rapid EV charging (and requirements for new stations to do so)Reassure people that they won't be disadvantaged in buying an EV, while acknowledging that the transition will take time.Australian Capital TerritorySignificant incentives are required for the next five years or so to kick-start the transition, phased down over the following 10 years.Adoption of European standards would be appropriate, phased in as quickly as practical to avoid the problem of pre-ban dumping of less efficient vehicles.Thank you for the opportunity to make a submission. I think it is important to counter a lot of the myths perpetuated by sceptics and opponents of EVs, but also not to overreach by arguing that EVs are a panacea.Fuel efficiency standards for heavy vehicles are important, but should not be used as an incentive for transferring freight (or passengers) from rail to road.\""
